OpenCV - Library used for tasks like image and video analysis

pillow - Working with images ( Satellite images .. TIP format --> high MB). Allows to open manupulate and save various image file formats. Can resize, enhance or convert images
       - High end image processing 

Scikit Images - Filtering, Segmentation ( different color for different object) and feature extraction 
      - ( eg. Airport auto scanning and SGPass login scan ) 

urllib - Working with URL. Opening and reading URL's.

SciPy - Scientific Python ->  Knife for Scientific and engineering calculation like number integeration, Optimization, signal processing
      - eg : like scientific calculation

NumPy - Numerical Python -> Numerical computations, Powerful array object called -> ndarray. Allows to perform mathematical operation on large database


Other lib :
pip install matplotlin
pip install imutils
pip install scipy
pip install seaborn

Applications : 

Object recogition
Face recognition
Mobile camera - low mps - Frame per second : video - Collection of images 
Agriculture
Satellite images
OCR - > Optical Character Recognization
Signography


Steps:
1. Gathering data -> image data
2. Data Cleaning / Data preprocessing -> only structure and shape required. NO NEED FOR COLOR IMAGES ... can convert grey images
3. Choosing a Model/ Concept -> What we gonna choose like concepts and Algorithms Eg : Computer vision / numeric 
4. Model Training 
5. Model Evaluation -> Testing 
6. Parameter Tuning - optional -> Improving evaluation eg : increaning data , preprocessing
7. Model Prediction -> Final output
